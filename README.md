# Bad-Decisions-Project

Hello there, this is the source code for my Bad Decisions Project. 

## Technologies Used

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Javascript

This is my first time making an interactive website from start to finish, so it took me quite a while. Approximately 50 hours for this small website that has 864 lines of code.
I also learned Javascript from scratch, and went from knowing nothing to using it passably by the end of the project.
I had only 3 weeks to make this website, so I'm pretty surprised it turned out as well as it did. That said, a star on this repo would be appreciated.

Thank you!
